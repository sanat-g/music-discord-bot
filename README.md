# music-discord-bot
A simple discord bot that plays music in voice channels with a interactive user interface coded with python using lavalink.py and lavanodes. 

Using Lavalink, I was able to connect the bot to a server that effectively plays music in a voice channel. Pynacl played a major role in creating this discord bot, and libraries from discord.py were essential to function this bot. The bot uses the prefix "?" which was added through discord.py using an extention . Bot is not currently public.
